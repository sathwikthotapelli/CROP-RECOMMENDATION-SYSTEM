The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project that helps farmers determine the most suitable crop to cultivate based on various environmental factors such as soil nutrients, temperature, and humidity. This system leverages data-driven insights to optimize agricultural productivity.

1 Features::

Predicts the best crop based on soil and climate conditions.

Uses a machine learning model trained on agricultural datasets.

Provides user-friendly interfaces for farmers to input data.

Helps improve agricultural yield and decision-making.

2 Dataset::

The dataset used for this project includes soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. It is sourced from reliable agricultural research datasets.
